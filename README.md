#Irreversibility of extreme precipitation intensity in global monsoon areas under multiple carbon neutrality scenarios

Abstract

The Global Monsoon Areas (GMAs), home to over half of the world population, face
escalating socio-economic risks from extreme precipitation events intensified by rising
atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ). While previous studies have examined the irreversibility
of the climate system following carbon neutrality, most have focused on single carbon
neutrality scenarios with limited attention to these vulnerable areas. This study assesses the
irreversibility of extreme precipitation intensity across seven GMA sub-regions under eight
future scenarios, incorporating four carbon neutrality targets and two reduction rates, using
simulations from a state-of-the-art climate model. Our results reveal that extreme
precipitation intensity exhibits irreversible behavior in response to carbon neutrality forcing,
failing to return to its initial level even when atmospheric CO₂ is reduced. This
irreversibility is particularly pronounced when carbon neutrality timing is delayed, and the
emission reduction rate is slow. Moreover, the irreversible response is nonlinear to the
magnitude of carbon forcing, leading to distinct regional vulnerabilities, with some areas
experiencing sharp increases in irreversibility by even small delays in reaching carbon
neutrality. This region-specific behavior is largely attributed to increases in mean and
variability of precipitation linked to irreversible El Niño-like warming and interhemispheric
differential warming. Moisture budget analysis further shows that the intensified precipitation
arises from the relative influence of thermodynamic (moisture flux) and dynamic (wind)
drivers across regions. These findings highlight the urgency of rapid policy implementation
in vulnerable regions and can provide a scientific basis for developing regional adaptation
strategies to mitigate growing extreme precipitation risks.
